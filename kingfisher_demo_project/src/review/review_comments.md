Improvements / Best Practices

1. Break the code in more modular structure.
    Have the type declaration in separate file
    EG: 
    types.ts ->
    export type Props = {
        userId: number
    }
    Import the type in the actual file and use it.

    Have the api integration is a seprate file
    EG: 
    apiIntegration.ts ->
    export const getData = (userId: Props)=>{

    }
    Let UserProfile.tsx only focus on redenring the data.


2. In place of 
    const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null)
    Incorporate a state management. This would help is better handlding of the different api call stages.

    In redux Store we can have different values in the state for the user. 

    const initialState ={
        loading:false,
        userData:null,
        error:false,
        errorDescription:''
    }

    before api call we can set the value for loading as true,
    We can map this initialState of the store to the UserProfile using 
    mapStatetoProps() and connect from redux or use of useContext()
    This way we can eliminate application state and maintain the entire state from a single store.


3. use React.Fragments in place of container <div></div>.
    Fragments provides a container but doesn't gets rendered in the DOM this makes the DOM lighter.


4. Incomplete unit Test converage. 
    Base on the test cases provided, only the loading state is checked for. 
    This puts the branch coverage to 50% but also other feature segments are not checked like the api call mocking and the success scenario checks.
    Magic strings can be defined in mock constants for better readibility and reuse. 
    Eg: const LOADING_TEST = 'loading'
    
    


Performace / Must Haves

1. In place of 
    const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null)
    
    Instead of 'any' type try defining type with known attributes like:
    type UserInfo = {
        userId?: number,
        name: string,
        bio: string,
    }
    use this type is response of api to map data in required type.

2. Inside the useEffect(()=>{},[])
    Instead of using fetch() 
    Replace with better libraries like axios.
    EG: 
    apiIntegration.ts ->
    export const getData = (userId: Props)=>{
        const response = await axios.get('sampleurl/{userID}')
        //Validate the response and check for status code before rendering in UI.
        //set the parsed value in the redux store for it to be rendered in UI.

    }


3. Missing error boundaries.
    In scenario of api api faiure the error is console logged in the background but no proper error handling is present in the UI. 
    It will show "loading" to user.

    EG: enclose the UserProfile component in wrapper error boundary component with sample fallback component. 
    
    The place where UserProfile has been imported

    import ErrorBoundaries from 'react-error-boundaries'
    const fallback = () => {
        return <div>Something went wrong</div>
    }
    <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent = {fallback()}>
        <UserProfile userID={testvalue}>
    </ErrorBoundary>
    

4. Missing null checks.
    Check for null value in:
    Before passing the value in api endpoint 
    EG: if(userId){
        //test code
        //fetch().then().then().catch()
    }

    Before rendering it in UI
    EG: const {name, bio} = user //destructing before rendering
    name && {<div>name</div>}
    bio && {<div>bio</div>}
     

5. Missing data validations. 
    On success api response data is directly mapped to the application state without any validation/mapping. 
    try incorporating:
    apiIntegration.ts ->
    export const getData = (userId: Props)=>{
        const response = await axios.get('sampleurl/{userID}')
        //Validate response to check for data and status codes
        //Map the response to the UI state
        const {name,bio}=response.data
        if(name && bio)
        return {
            name,
            bio
        } as UserType
    }
This way if response doesn't have name and bio then UI won't break in scenario of nulls.


6. Write test cases for scenaios of api failure and success scenario.
    EG: 
    Assign id to the name and bio element and mock the api call to check for test results
    <h1 id='userName'>{user.name}</h1>
    <h1 id='userBio'>{user.name}</h1>

    expect(screen.getById('userName')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getById('userBio')).toBeInTheDocument();


    For api failure mock fetch() to give error, 
    console.log = jest.fn()
    //on api failure check
    expect(console.log).tohaveBeenCalled(1);
