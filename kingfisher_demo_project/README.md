This project is a minimal setup of a React Application to incorporate the snippet of the coding review.
The main content of the project resides in 2 folder:
1. src-> utils: Here we have declared a helper function for flattening the object. 
Respective unit tests are also included.
2. src->review: this folder has a single .md file with the code review comments listed.
